    # Attribute 'path' specifies set of objects which should be monitored. For each placeholder (defined with ${...}) any
    # value will be accepted (while also storing the value of that placeholder). In the example below, if some setup has
    # 3 indices (say 'A', 'B' and 'C), each with 2 shards, meaning a total of 6 shards, there will be a total of 6
    # matching objects found by this path expression (regardless off on which nodes which shards are, since total number of
    # shards is 6 anyway).
    # For each of those 6 objects, placeholder values will be available for use in tag definitions (notice how value of
    # "es.node.id" and "es.index" tags are specified - they will be resolved to exact values matching one of those 6 objects).
